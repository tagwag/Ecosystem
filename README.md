# Ecosystem

Ecosystem is an experimental program to observe "evolution" in the forms of different entities. 
Current Entities added are Cells, Worms, Squids. 
The goal is that each entity will play a key part in their ecosystem that allows them to survive and evolve.
Currently only Cells can evolve and develop subspecies, Worms will soon have some sort of evolution.
