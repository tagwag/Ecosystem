    So far:
    I have a working algorithm for executing basic survival functions: Flight, Fight, Search.
    My current problem is creating the cell split function. It might be best to place the cell split function on hold and instead
    focus on programming evolution by setting a specific time length for each generation and for which ever cells survive I carry
    their traits into the next generation and add mutation chance. This can help me refine the basic instinct of the cell so that
    when I do add cell splitting in the future it will be with advanced natural instinct allowing me to attribute any bugs to my
    implementation of cell splitting and not the possibility of the bug occurring elsewhere within my code.
    Design:
    1. Quantify each aspect of Flight, Fight, and Search and make them be represented by a matrix.
        * Find a way to make this data represent color so that cells can be distinguished from each other by Instinct.
        * I feel like making Sight a factor of seeking and a trait that can change might greatly influence this whole algorithm.
            * If it only needs to see enough food to survive it might not have ability to see far.
            * If it's too slow to eat food boxes but can see far enough to find prey to eat then it could survive.
            * I think Sight is a key survival trait that should change with evolution.
        * Quantify Threat Tolerance, this could be an interesting thing.

    2. Quantify order of instinct and make them be represented by a matrix.
    3. Create "leaderboard" which stores surviving Cells and their Instinct.
    4. Add pulling data from leaderboard file so that surviving instinct can be passed on.
    4. Add Mutation Roll which will mutate traits of Instinct.
    5. Refine how size affects energy consumption and movement speed.
        * Set a score requirement where a cell must consume so much energy in order to have it's traits passed on.
        * Leftover score is converted into a size growth.
        * Size affects speed. If too big, then the cell is too slow and cannot eat enough to survive to the next round.
