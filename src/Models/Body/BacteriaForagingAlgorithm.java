/*
Bacteria Foraging Optimization (BFO) algorithm invented by K. M. Passino [10] is a relatively new population-based algorithm;
it is a nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm, which imitates the foraging behavior of E. coli.
An E. coli bacterium can move in two different ways; it can run (swim for a period of time),
or it can tumble, and it alternates between these two modes of operation through its entire lifetime.
By tumbling and running, the bacteria will search for nutrient area and keep away from the poisonous area, as shown in Fig. 1.
